# 15 Puzzle Solver using A* Search 
This program asks the user to input the order of numbers 0-15 and the program will generates a 15 block puzzle with that order. The program then solves 
this puzzle by using a popular and powerful search algorithm known as A* search. The implementation used is able to solve worst case scenerio (1-15 backwards)
in an instant. This mini project done for a college course.
